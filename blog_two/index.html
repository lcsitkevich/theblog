<h5> The Oaks Gourmet was established in 2009. Similar to Joan’s on Third, the restaurant attempts to replicate a small neighborhood “market”. It is located on Bronson Avenue in Los Angeles. I took a stroll over to the Oaks Gourmet early in the morning around 8 am. The service was great and my food was served quickly and efficiently. When I first read the ingredients for the avocado toast on the menu, I was unsure about the combination of ingredients. For $11.95 they give you– “Smashed avocado, basil aioli, alfalfa sprouts, tomato, crisp garlic, jammy egg, seven grain toast”. </h5>




<h5>
In all honesty The ingredients did not pan out very well. Individually all of the flavors would have been great, however the combination was a bit strange. Although this place was less expensive than Joan’s on Third, I would say that Joan’s on Third had ingredients that simply meshed better. For starters the “Jammy Egg” was the toast’s downfall. I thought it was awesome that the restaurant chose to put eggs on their avocado toast. Kudos to them for that however I think it might have been better if the egg was scrambled or over-easy. It felt more like an open faced sandwich than avocado toast due to the large amount of toppings. </h5>

<h5>If I were to make any dramatic changes to the dish I would vouch for less sprouts, I love sprouts but in this instance they almost outshine the avocado which is one of the most important parts. My favorite part about the dish was the consistency of the avocado and the multigrain bread that they used. I like the way it was cut up and strategically placed on the bread and eating it I could tell it was great quality.  —> RATING (7.0/10). </h5>
