<h5>I went with my mom to this destination after a quick visit to the dentist. Joan’s on Third has a couple locations, but this specific piece of toast is from the Studio City location. The restaurant is pretty popular and is set up like a miniature marketplace. It was started by Joan McNamara. She opened Joan’s on Third with her daughters in 1995. Breakfast is served all day which is awesome and extra convenient for my avocado toast review. </h5>


 <h5>Starting off, the staff was really nice. The restaurant is not sit down style instead you must order up front, get a number and then find a seat. It was a sunny day so we sat outside. The avocado toast was $12.95. I did not get it with the egg on top which would have been an additional $3. The menu describes the avocado as  “Served on Bub and Grandma’s sesame country bread. Topped with tomatoes and thinly sliced radish”. That is a perfect description. When I first took a bite it was almost as if I could taste lemon within the avocado mash. Not fully sure if it was mixed in however. The bread was the perfect consistency and was not soggy at all. I loved the colorful cherry tomatoes and the radishes were a great addition. The restaurant did a good job at providing a lot of avocado and they definitely did not skimp out. I would also say that the avocado mash was thoroughly mashed. I know some people like it chunkier than others or potentially more mashed than others. </h5>


<h5> When it comes to the down side I thought it was too much avocado compared to the bread/toast. After all it is called avocado toast for a reason and there should also be a strong standing toast element. That could have just been a personal choice from me however. In addition I wish there were more toppings.  → RATING = (9/10) </h5>
