<h5>
    This bagel came out to 12 dollars exactly and is one thousand percent worth checking out! The restaurant describes the avocado toast on the menu as “smashed avocado, arugula, pickled onion, lemon, olive oil, fresh ground pepper”. This is a great description. Going into trying out this bagel, I already knew there was going to be a creative twist as it uses a bagel as its bread choice.  
</h5>

<h5> In trying this avocado toast, I noticed that the lemon and dill flavor was really strong, which I love because they definitely do not skimp on the spices. Those flavors also pair really well with avocado. The pickled onions were also great, I appreciated how they added a nice pink color. </h5>

<h5> If you would also like to order this avocado toast, make sure to go to 4th street off of Clement, and the order is titled “for the batches”. Overall, I rate this avocado toast is a 10/10!
